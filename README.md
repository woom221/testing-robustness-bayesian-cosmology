## About

I conducted a summer research project focused on testing the robustness of Bayesian Model Comparison methods, including the Deviance Information Criterion and Bayes Factor, in the context of Cosmological Analysis.

In this project, I found that Bayesian Model Comparison methods should be applied with caution, as they can potentially overlook subtle fluctuations in parameter values, such as dark energy parameters or the sum of neutrino masses, leading to a loss of critical information.
